## Note

The Calculator does not show the steps to solve the equations, system of equations, derivative... but only for the final result.
Enter sin(30°) to calculate sine Degree mode

The computer can work in two modes:
- 	Decimal mode: 0.12312312323
- 	Mode fractions: for results with arbitrary precision, for example 9^99999
