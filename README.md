# Calculator N+ - Powerful calculator for Android.
I am no longer supported the development of this project, pull request are welcome.

## Overview
This is a powerful android calculator that contains most of the features needed. The power of the application is through the use of the Symja library. The results are displayed by Latex technology. The application is designed as material design. This project is an open source project that allows people to study, ad-free application.

## ALGEBRA

	1. Computer science
	2. Solving the equation:
	3. Solve system equations
	4. Graphing
	6. Unit Conversions
	8. Simplify expressions
	9. Polynomial factorization.
	10. Binomial expansion Newton
	11. Matrix

## ANALYTICS

	1. Derivative
	2. Antiderivative
	3. Definite integrals
	4. Find the limit of the sequence, function

## TRIGONOMETRIC

	1. Trigonometric expand: sin(2x) -> 2sin(x)cos(x)
	2. Trigonometric reduce: 2sin(x)cos(x) -> sin(2x)
	3. Trigonometric to exponent: sinh(x) -> (e^x-e^(-x))/2

## DETERMINATION OF STATISTICS

	1. Combination
	2. Permutation

## SOME OTHER FEATURES

	1. Prime factors
	2. Modulo
	3. Catalan number
	4. Fibonacci number
	5. Pi number

## Note

The Calculator does not show the steps to solve the equations, system of equations, derivative... but only for the final result.
Enter sin(30°) to calculate sine Degree mode

The computer can work in two modes:
- 	Decimal mode: 0.12312312323
- 	Mode fractions: for results with arbitrary precision, for example 9^99999
